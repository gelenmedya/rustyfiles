//! What the hook thread and the interface thread share: a handful of atomics. The hook callback reads and writes ONLY these (and its
//! own fields): no lock, no allocation, nothing that can wait. Everything the interface thread wants the hook to know goes in here
//! (the settings, the heartbeat, "a full-screen program is in front", "the switcher closed"); everything the hook wants the
//! interface to know goes out through the queue (`queue.rs`) or is read back from here (`believed`, `mask_failures`).
//!
//! FAIL OPEN. The interface thread stamps the heartbeat every [`HEARTBEAT_EVERY_MS`]. When the stamp is older than
//! [`STALE_AFTER_MS`] (four missed beats: the interface is stuck, busy or gone) - or has never been made - the layer passes EVERY
//! key and swallows nothing, so a stuck rustyfiles can never take Alt+Tab or the Windows key away. The same happens while a
//! full-screen program is in front (the dock's own full-screen test, stamped with the heartbeat): our panels do not open above one,
//! so a swallowed key would do nothing at all.
