//! One app's own sound level: read it, and turn it up or down by the mouse wheel's notches.
//!
//! WHY (issue 21, a user of the dock: "will be good control volume level per app by scrolling over app icon"). Windows keeps a level
//! for every program that plays sound (the "volume mixer"); the dock's icon is the nearest handle on a program there is.
//!
//! WHICH SOUNDS ARE AN APP'S. Windows names a sound session by the PROCESS that plays it, and that is often not the process of the
//! app's window: a browser plays from a helper process, an Electron app from a child. So a session belongs to the nearest process, going
//! up from the one that plays through its parents, that has a window on the dock ([`owner_of`]). "Nearest" matters: a player started
//! from a terminal has its own icon, and its sound is its own, not the terminal's. Three things end the walk with no owner: the shell's
//! process (nearly every program descends from it), this process (apps started from the dock are its children), and a "parent" that was
//! created AFTER its child: process numbers are reused, and such a parent is a newer program that only has the dead parent's number.
//!
//! WHAT IS CHANGED: the session's own level (`ISimpleAudioVolume`), the very value the volume mixer shows; the system's master level
//! is not touched. Every session of the app gets the same new level. Turning up takes the mute off, as the volume keys do.
//!
//! Everything here blocks for a few milliseconds (the audio service is asked across processes): call it off the UI thread. Two calls at
//! once would each read the old level and write the same new one; a lock makes each notch count.
