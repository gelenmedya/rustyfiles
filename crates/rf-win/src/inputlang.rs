//! The input language (keyboard layout): which ones the user has, which one the window in front is typing in, and a request to switch.
//!
//! WHY (issue 21, a user of the dock: "also i don't see language switcher icon"). Windows' taskbar shows the input language beside the
//! clock ("ENG", "TUR") and switches it on a click. With the dock in the taskbar's place nothing showed it, and a user with two
//! layouts could not tell which one a window was in.
//!
//! WHAT IS READ. The layout is a property of a THREAD: each window types in the layout of the thread that owns it, and Alt+Shift (or
//! Win+Space) changes it for the window in front. So "the current language" is the layout of the foreground window's thread. Nothing
//! here is sent to that window to read it. Reading is two system calls; the dock looks a few times a second and only while the user
//! has more than one layout.
//!
//! SWITCHING is the request Windows itself defines for it (`WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST`, posted to the window in front, as the
//! language bar does): the window's own thread makes the change. A window of a program that runs as administrator does not take a
//! posted message from this process; its layout then stays as it is, which the indicator goes on showing truthfully.
