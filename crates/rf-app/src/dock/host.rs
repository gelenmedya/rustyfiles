//! The dock process's centre: the docks (one per monitor), their island windows, their places, the system events they react to (display,
//! DPI, theme, full-screen, time), the settings file, and the clean exit.
//!
//! ONE DOCK PER MONITOR. The host holds a list of [`Dock`]s: a value that is everything ONE monitor has (the monitor, its layout, its three
//! windows and their glass, its widths, its pointer region, what it holds, whether it is hidden for a full-screen program there). The first
//! one, [`MonId::HOME`], is the dock the process always had: it follows the primary monitor, takes its band and holds everything (the
//! weather, the tray strip, the network and volume buttons). The others are the secondary monitors' docks, found by the monitors'
//! DEVICE NAMES (`rf_win::dock::monitors`), opened and closed as monitors come and go, and only there while "Dock'u her ekranda göster"
//! is on. Everything else (the settings, the glass engine, the system watcher, the panels, the icon cache) is shared. With one monitor, or
//! the switch off, the list holds the home dock only and the code below does exactly what it did before the list existed.
//!
//! WHICH MONITOR A QUESTION IS ABOUT. An island's own view always knows its monitor ([`MonId`], asked with the `_on` functions). The
//! panels, the app menu and the previews are shared by all monitors (one at a time), so the functions they use (`visible_glass_rect`,
//! `monitor_work`, `island_window`, ...) answer for the ACTIVE monitor: the one whose island was pressed or hovered last, which an open
//! panel keeps until it is gone ([`set_active`]).
//!
//! THE WINDOWS ARE BIGGER THAN THE GLASS. Each island's window holds its glass plus a transparent margin (a few px; room for the shadow only with `RUSTYFILES_DOCK_SHADOW=1`; for the middle
//! island also headroom for the icons that grow out of the glass and room for the glass to widen). `layout::placements` works out
//! both rectangles; the host keeps the result (`Dock::geo`) for the views, tells the glass engine where the glass is inside its window
//! (`IslandGlass::set_shape`) and gives every window a REGION (`rf_win::dock::hit`) so that the margin lets the pointer through to
//! other programs' windows.
//!
//! WHY WIN32 CALLS GO THROUGH A TASK. Moving or styling a GPUI window sends it messages (`WM_SIZE`, `WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED`) that GPUI
//! answers by updating the window. When that happens while the app is being updated (inside a click handler, a render, a
//! `cx.update`), the answer cannot be taken and the window keeps its old size in GPUI's eyes. So every call that moves, styles,
//! shows or hides a window is made from a foreground-executor task, which runs from the message loop with nothing borrowed (this is
//! also how GPUI's own `Window::resize` does it).
