//! The Start panel: the view that opens above the left island when its logo (or its search field) is clicked. 642 x 720 logical px at
//! most (never taller than the room above the island), on HyperGlass (`panel.rs` opens, places and closes it; this is what is inside).
//! The numbers and the decisions are `rf_win::dock::startpage`; the drawing of the pages is `start_home.rs`.
//!
//! * Top: a search field (a pill) with the keyboard in it. Typing is the search from either page. (While the left island's glass has
//!   grown into the panel the field stands in the island's row at the bottom of the glass, exactly where the island's own field is, and
//!   the top holds a header with the account, the gear and the power button instead: `start_row.rs`, `grow_head.rs`.)
//! * Two pages, and the panel always opens on the first. HOME: "Sabitlenenler" (the user's pinned apps, six columns of tiles, three
//!   rows, more of them on pages with dots at the grid's right edge; right click any app to pin or unpin it) with a "Tümü" button, and
//!   "Önerilenler" (the documents opened most recently, two columns; the setting `dock_start_recommended`). ALL APPS ("Tümü" opens it,
//!   "Geri" and Escape and Backspace on an empty search lead back): "Tüm uygulamalar", every installed app in the alphabet of the
//!   user's language with letter headers, in the app's virtual list: only the rows in view are built and only they ask for an icon.
//! * With a query: the result list of the quick search (`quick_search::search_local`, and the files the running rustyfiles answers
//!   over a pipe: `search_pipe`). Local rows appear within a frame of the keystroke; the files arrive after them without moving the row
//!   the user is on (`search.rs`).
//! * Bottom: the user's account picture and name, the gear (Windows' Settings) and the power button (Kilitle, Uyku, Oturumu kapat,
//!   Yeniden başlat, Bilgisayarı kapat; the last two ask "Emin misiniz?" first, in the panel). (In the grown panel they are the header.)
//!
//! Keyboard: typing goes to the field wherever the pointer was last clicked; the arrows move through the grid, the recommended entries
//! and the list (or the results), Page Up and Page Down turn the grid's pages, Tab goes field, Tümü (Geri), gear, power; Enter starts
//! the one under the cursor, Ctrl+Enter shows it in its folder in rustyfiles, Escape steps back (query, all apps, then the panel).
//! With the field in the island's row under the content the way to the content is Up and the way back Down, and Tab follows the order on
//! the screen (`rf_win::dock::startkeys`). The result list reads top down with the best match first, selected and marked "Enter".
//!
//! Beside the result list stands the DETAIL PANE of the selected result (`start_pane.rs`): what it is, what can be done with it, an
//! app's jump list. Tab leads into it, and Ctrl+Shift+Enter starts the selected app as administrator.
//!
//! Menus (right click on an app, the power button) are drawn inside this window: a separate menu window would take the activation and
//! the panel would close under it.
