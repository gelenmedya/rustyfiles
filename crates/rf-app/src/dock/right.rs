//! The right island: a network and a volume symbol (they show the real state and open our own control centre, `control_centre.rs`;
//! with "rustyfiles denetim merkezini kullan" off they open Windows' quick settings as before), a thin separator, the time and the date in two
//! lines (they open our own calendar panel, `cal_view.rs`; Windows' notification centre and calendar with "rustyfiles takvimini kullan"
//! off) and a bell (our own notification panel, `notif_view.rs`, with a small dot while there are notifications; Windows' notification
//! centre with "rustyfiles bildirim panelini kullan" off). All of it is the user's
//! own click on that element; nothing here ever presses a key by itself.
//!
//! THE SYMBOLS follow the system: the volume symbol is the level in steps, muted, or no sound device; the network symbol is Ethernet,
//! Wi-Fi in four strengths, or not connected (`sysstate.rs` keeps the sources, which call back when Windows says something changed).
//!
//! THE ISLAND'S OWN BUTTONS are those two symbols, Windows Security and safe removal (while a removable drive holds a volume). Their
//! order and which of them are shown are the user's (Settings > Dock > "Durum simgeleri"; `rf_win::dock::status_order`). A button
//! can also be DRAGGED to another place among them, as the programs' tray icons beside them are: the press is followed by looks at
//! the pointer (`tray_strip::step`, the same rule and the same four logical px before a press is a drag), the dragged button is drawn
//! faint, a thin mark in the accent colour shows where it would land, and the release writes the new order to the settings. A press
//! that never became a drag is the button's click.
//!
//! ON A SECONDARY MONITOR (`mon` is not the home dock) the island holds the clock and the bell only: the tray strip, the network and
//! volume symbols and the separator after them stay on the primary monitor's, as on Windows' secondary taskbars; on a narrow monitor the
//! bell goes too (`rf_win::dock::monitors::content`).
