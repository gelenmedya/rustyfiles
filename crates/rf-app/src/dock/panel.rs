//! The dock's panels: borderless windows on HyperGlass that open above an island (the Start panel above the left island, the control
//! centre above the right one). The arithmetic and the decisions are `rf_win::dock::panel` (placement, toggle, what closes a panel,
//! who gets the keyboard back, the 120 ms easing); this file puts them on windows. Each panel is a slot: its id, the island it sits
//! above and lines up with, its window, and the hooks that tell its view what is happening to it.
//!
//! WHAT WAS CHOSEN. A panel's window is made WHEN IT IS FIRST OPENED (the click that asks for it makes it, from a task of the foreground
//! executor, `panel_more::toggle_made`) and kept, HIDDEN, from then on; every later opening is a move, a show and a bring to the front.
//! Until a panel is first asked for it costs nothing at all: no window, no swap chain, no view tree. (They used to be made hidden at the
//! dock's start; a dock that never opens a panel, or one that opens only the Start panel, held up to four idle GPUI windows for
//! nothing.) The price is one window creation at the first click of each panel; the time from the click to the panel being shown is
//! logged at info level (`dock: panel ... shown in ...`) with a note when the window was made for it. A panel at rest has no timer,
//! no thread and no glass: the glass engine is attached when the panel opens and taken off when it has closed. While the glass starts
//! (a few frames) the panel paints the plain fill the popups paint (`glass_watch::panel_fill`).
//!
//! THE KEYBOARD. The islands are never activated; a panel is. On opening, the window that is in front is remembered; the panel is
//! brought to the front (the click that opened it was this process's own input, which is what lets it take the foreground) and its
//! view takes the keys. When the panel is put away with Escape or by its button the remembered window gets the foreground back (if
//! nobody else took it meanwhile); after a click elsewhere or a thing started from the panel the foreground is left alone.
//!
//! WHAT CLOSES IT. Escape; a mouse button going down outside the panel and outside its own island (the island's button toggles it);
//! another window taking the foreground; the dock hiding for a full-screen application; the monitor, its scale or its work area
//! changing (the islands move, the panel would be left behind); Alt+F4 (the window is kept, only put away); its button again. While a panel is open one
//! task looks every 50 ms at the foreground and the mouse buttons for the last two; while none is open nothing runs. Only one panel
//! is open at a time: opening the other puts the first away at once.
//!
//! A PANEL'S HEIGHT may change while it is open (the control centre gains a card when a media session starts): [`relayout`] places it
//! again, still 8 px above its island, so it grows upwards.
//!
//! ALL WIN32 CALLS THAT MOVE, SHOW, HIDE OR FOCUS A WINDOW run in a task of the foreground executor, outside any update of the app
//! (see the notes at the top of `host.rs`).
