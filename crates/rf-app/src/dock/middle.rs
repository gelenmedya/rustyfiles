//! The middle island, the dock itself: the apps pinned to the Windows taskbar in the taskbar's order, then the other running apps,
//! a thin separator, the Recycle Bin and the Downloads folder. Icons are 44 px at rest. With the pointer over the dock they grow like
//! the Mac's dock (`rf_win::dock::magnify`): by a smooth bell of the distance from the pointer to each icon's rest centre, up to 1.55
//! times for the one under it (a setting: off / subtle 1.25 / full 1.55), standing on one baseline so they grow UP, over the glass's top
//! edge, into the window's headroom, and pushing their neighbours apart. The glass widens with them, symmetrically around the island's
//! centre (its height never changes); coming in and going out are eased over about 160 ms, instantly when the app's animations are off.
//!
//! THE WINDOW IS BIGGER THAN THE GLASS (`layout::placements`): this view lays everything out in the whole window, from the margins the
//! host gives it (`host::insets`), and for every frame tells the glass engine where the glass is and the system which parts of the
//! window take the pointer (`host::set_middle_frame`): the glass and the icons that stand out of it, nothing else.
//!
//! THE SIZE. All the arithmetic here (the rest layout, the magnification, the picture, the boxes) is in dock units, the default size's
//! logical px; only where something is drawn or measured on the window is a length multiplied by the dock's size factor (`k`), and the
//! device conversions use the dock unit (the monitor's scale times `k`).
//!
//! At rest there are no timers and no frames. While the pointer moves over the dock: one layout, one shape for the engine, one region
//! for the system per frame; the icons are never loaded again for it.
//!
//! Left click: start the app / bring its last used window forward / minimise it when it is in front. Middle click: another instance.
//! A click is answered by the icon (`feedback.rs`): a start bounces it and shows a pulsing mark under it until the app has a window, a
//! window brought forward gives it a pulse, a minimise a dip, a failed start a shake. Pressing an icon and moving sideways picks it up
//! (`reorder.rs`): it follows the pointer, the others make room, and on release the pin list (a pinned app) or the island's remembered
//! order (a running one) is rewritten; a running app dropped among the pinned ones is pinned there.
//! Right click on an icon: the dock's own app menu (`app_menu.rs`); on the empty glass between and around the icons: Windows' Task Manager
//! (`empty.rs`). The pointer resting on a running app's icon: a preview of its windows
//! (`hover_preview.rs`). Both are anchored on the icon's centre AT REST (it does not move while the icons grow). The pins are the
//! Windows taskbar's until the user pins or unpins from the menu, then the dock's own list (`own_pins.rs`).
